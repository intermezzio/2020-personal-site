Before my first year of college, I worked for MIT's School of Engineering as a TA for the Beaver Works Summer Institute. With a team of program faculty members, I created course content for the Remote Sensing for Crisis Response program, as it was the first year the course was offered. I worked with Raspberry Pis on kites to take aerial images, and used Flask to present the images on a website. In addition, I built a couple of websites as documentation for the course.
