Before my senior year of high school, I enrolled in the MIT Beaver Works Summer Institute, where I worked with a team of students from across the country to programmed a drone to fly autonomously. More specifically, I worked with Intel's Ready to Fly research drones using ROS to program open loop and closed loop autonomous control.
